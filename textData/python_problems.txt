Problem Statements
Countdown Timer: Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number and then counts down to zero from that number, printing each number to the screen.

Multiplication Table Printer: Use a for loop to print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10. The program should ask the user to enter a number.

Odd or Even: Write a program that asks the user for a number and uses an if-else condition to print whether the number is odd or even.

Simple Interest Calculator: Create a program that calculates simple interest given the principal amount, rate of interest, and time. Use input to get the values from the user and then perform the calculation.

Password Validator: Write a program that asks the user to create a password and then enter it again to confirm. Use string matching to check if the passwords match and print an appropriate message.

Sum of Natural Numbers: Use a for loop to find the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers. 'n' should be entered by the user.

Factorial Calculator: Write a program using a while loop to calculate the factorial of a given number. The number should be input by the user.

Temperature Converter: Create a program that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. The program should ask the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and print the converted temperature.

Grade Calculator: Ask the user for their marks in 5 subjects, calculate the average, and print the grade based on the average using if-else conditions. (A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, E: Below 60)

Positive Number Counter: Write a program using a while loop that asks the user to enter numbers until they enter a negative number. At the end, print the count of positive numbers entered.

Solution Programs
Now, let's proceed with the solutions for each problem statement.

Here are the solutions for the problem statements provided:

Countdown Timer
python
Copy code
n = int(input("Enter a number to countdown from: "))
while n >= 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
Multiplication Table Printer
python
Copy code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {num*i}")
Odd or Even
python
Copy code
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is Even")
else:
    print(f"{number} is Odd")
Simple Interest Calculator
python
Copy code
P = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
R = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
T = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))
SI = (P * R * T) / 100
print(f"Simple Interest: {SI}")
Password Validator
python
Copy code
password = input("Create your password: ")
confirm_password = input("Enter your password again: ")
if password == confirm_password:
    print("Password match.")
else:
    print("Passwords do not match.")
Sum of Natural Numbers
python
Copy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
sum = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    sum += i
print(f"The sum of the first {n} natural numbers is {sum}")
Factorial Calculator
python
Copy code
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
while n > 0:
    factorial *= n
    n -= 1
print(f"The factorial is {factorial}")
Temperature Converter
python
Copy code
fahrenheit = float(input("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: "))
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9
print(f"Temperature in Celsius is {celsius}")
Grade Calculator
python
Copy code
marks = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    marks.append(float(input(f"Enter marks for subject {i}: ")))
average = sum(marks) / len(marks)
if average >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif average >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif average >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif average >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'E'
print(f"Your grade is {grade}")
Positive Number Counter
python
Copy code
count = 0
number = float(input("Enter a number (negative to stop): "))
while number >= 0:
    count += 1
    number = float(input("Enter another number (negative to stop): "))
print(f"Positive numbers entered: {count}")
